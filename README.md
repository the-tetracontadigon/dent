# Dent Client

> Ghost mode loading...

Very much a PoC at this point. Abandoned (for now).

Injects into MC through a mod that can be disguised. Creates an external database that can
interact with hooks in-game to create clients on top of a "client-server" architecture
within the client. Aims to be undetectable.
