Very much a WIP. Closed source (and for profit.)

## MVP Roadmap

### Pre-Project

- Which frontends/modules/backends should be in the initial release?

- Business model

- Branding

### Frontends

- Basic generic framework for all frontends

- WebUI frontend

- Electron version of the WebUI styled slightly differently ðŸ˜ˆ

- CLI frontend (look like [void clicker](https://imgs.search.brave.com/hFJLkgM9syz87wNunLdQN3ncJhSol3Zk6Levg0Qj1Q8/rs:fit:1200:720:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pLnl0/aW1nLmNvbS92aS9y/LWcxQWdmV3dOQS9t/YXhyZXNkZWZhdWx0/LmpwZw)?)

### Backends

- Define which hooks are needed

- Define how hooks interface with the frontend (local API? files? how does this stay hidden?)

- Fabric mod implementation of all hooks, more for mockup and testing purposes

- External backend (lunar?)

### Release

- HWID system

- Monitoring?

- Website

- Trailer video

- Social media teasers

- Vetting for customers: make sure they're not a dev/admin/troll

## Building

currently nothing to really build :(

## Contribution Guidelines

use conventional commits (look it up). commit for **every feature added**

refactor for performance/security/modularity *after* creating a feature
